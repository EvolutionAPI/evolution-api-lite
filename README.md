## Introduction

**Evolution API Lite** is a lightweight version of the Evolution API, focusing solely on connectivity without the integrations and audio conversion features. It is designed to be more efficient and ideal for microservice environments where performance and simplicity are key.

## Core Features

- **WhatsApp Connectivity**: Provides connectivity via WhatsApp Web using the [Baileys library](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys).
- **Official WhatsApp Cloud API**: Connects via Meta's official API for more reliable and scalable usage.

This version does not include integrations with external platforms like Typebot, Chatwoot, OpenAI or S3/Minio, and there are no audio conversion features. It's optimized for those who need fast, simple connectivity solutions.

## Telemetry Notice

To continuously improve our services, we have implemented telemetry that collects data on the routes used, the most accessed routes, and the version of the API in use. We would like to assure you that no sensitive or personal data is collected during this process. The telemetry helps us identify improvements and provide a better experience for users.
